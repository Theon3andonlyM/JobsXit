# JobsXit  

ðŸš€ **A Prototype for Smarter Job Searching**  


ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [JobsXit is live!](https://theon3andonlym.github.io/JobsXit/)


### **Overview**  
JobsXit is an innovative job aggregator platform designed to simplify job searching. Instead of checking multiple job boards separately, users can search from one unified platformâ€”similar to flight comparison sites.  

### **Features**  
âœ… **Job Aggregation:** Collects listings from multiple sources  
âœ… **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and simple design  
âœ… **Scalability:** Built with modular architecture for future improvements  

### **Current Status**  
ðŸ“Œ This is an early prototype. Right now, it uses **dummy job listings** for demonstration purposes. The goal is to integrate **real-time job data** and advanced search filters in future iterations.  

### **Future Plans**  
ðŸ”¹ Implement **real job listings from APIs**  
ðŸ”¹ Add **custom filtering options** for IT roles  
ðŸ”¹ Improve **UI/UX for a seamless experience**
